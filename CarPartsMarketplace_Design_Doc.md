### B. API Design Principles
*   **Style:** Primarily RESTful; consider GraphQL for specific needs.
*   **Versioning:** URI versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT for stateless auth; RBAC.
*   **HTTP Methods:** Consistent use of GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE.
*   **URL Structure:** Clear, hierarchical, resource-oriented.
*   **Request/Response Format:** JSON; consistent naming conventions.
*   **Status Codes:** Accurate HTTP status code usage.
*   **Error Handling:** Standardized error responses (error code, message, details).
*   **Data Handling:** Pagination, sorting, filtering.
*   **Rate Limiting:** To prevent abuse.
*   **Security:** HTTPS, input validation, OWASP Top 10 considerations.
*   **Documentation:** OpenAPI (Swagger).
*   **Idempotency:** For PUT/DELETE operations.
*(Note: API responses with monetary values will indicate ZAR currency.)*

### C. Performance & Scalability
*   **Database Optimization:** Indexing, read replicas, query optimization, connection pooling.
*   **Caching Strategies:** CDN for static assets, application-level caching (Redis/Memcached) for frequently accessed data.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Background jobs/workers (Celery, RabbitMQ) for emails, image processing, reports.
*   **Efficient Search:** Dedicated search solutions (Elasticsearch, Algolia) for large catalogs.
*   **Stateless Application Architecture:** For horizontal scaling.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across application servers.
*   **Code Optimization:** Avoid N+1 queries, profiling, performance testing.
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Cloud-based (AWS, Azure, GCP), containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes).
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry).

### D. Currency (ZAR) & Localization
*   **Primary Currency:** South African Rand (ZAR) for all transactions, listings, and financial reporting.
*   **Display:** Prices formatted as "R 1,234.56".
*   **Payment Gateway:** Must fully support ZAR transactions (e.g., PayFast, Yoco, Peach Payments).
*   **Localization (Initial Focus - South Africa):**
    *   **Language:** English (South African English).
    *   **Date/Time Formats:** Common SA formats.
    *   **Addresses:** Structured for SA addresses.
    *   **Future Internationalization:** Design with potential future expansion in mind (resource files for UI text, UTC dates).

### E. Potential 3rd Party Integrations
*   **Payment Gateways:** (As above, ZAR support crucial).
*   **Shipping APIs:** (e.g., uAfrica, EasyPost, Shippo - if offering integrated shipping).
*   **Vehicle Data APIs:** For VIN lookup, enhanced compatibility data (consider cost/availability in SA).
*   **Analytics Services:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.
*   **Communication Services:** For SMS (Twilio, Vonage), Email (SendGrid, Mailgun).
*   **KYC/Identity Verification Services:** For robust seller verification.

## 5. Monetization Strategy

*(Examples; final strategy to be determined)*
*   **Commission per Sale:** A percentage fee charged to sellers on successful sales (e.g., 5-15% depending on category/seller tier).
*   **Listing Fees:** A small fee to list an item (less common for C2C, more for B2C or premium categories).
*   **Featured Listings:** Sellers pay a premium to have their listings highlighted or appear at the top of search results.
*   **Seller Subscription Tiers:** Monthly/annual fee for sellers offering benefits that could scale with tier levels. For example:
    *   **Basic Tier (or Free Tier with higher commission):** Limited number of active listings, standard commission rate, basic support.
    *   **Standard Tier:** Increased number of active listings, slightly reduced commission rate, access to basic sales analytics, standard support. May include a "Standard Seller" badge.
    *   **Premium Tier:** High or unlimited active listings, significantly reduced commission rate, advanced sales analytics and reporting, priority support, potential for more featured listing credits, access to promotional tools. Includes a distinct **"Pro Seller" or "Premium Seller" badge** on their profile and listings to enhance buyer trust and visibility.
*   **Advertising Space for Relevant Businesses:** Offering ad placements (e.g., banner ads, sponsored content) to complementary businesses such as mechanics, insurance companies, or automotive accessory retailers. Care must be taken to ensure ads are relevant and not overly intrusive to the user experience.
*   **Value-Added Services:** E.g., premium support (beyond tier benefits), marketing packages for sellers, professional photography services for listings (if feasible).
*(All fees denominated in ZAR)*

## 6. Legal & Compliance Considerations (South Africa Focus)

*(High-level pointers; specific legal advice required)*
*   **A. Data Privacy (POPIA Compliance):**
    *   Obtain user consent for data collection and processing.
    *   Securely store and manage personal information.
    *   Provide users with access to their data and the right to be forgotten.
    *   Appoint an Information Officer.
    *   Clear Privacy Policy.
*   **B. Consumer Protection Act (CPA) Implications:**
    *   Ensure fair and honest dealings.
    *   Accurate product descriptions and disclosures (especially for used parts).
    *   Clear policies on returns, refunds, and warranties (implied or explicit).
    *   Plain language in terms and conditions.
*   **C. E-commerce Regulations:**
    *   Adherence to the Electronic Communications and Transactions (ECT) Act.
    *   Provide clear information about the business, products, and terms of sale.
*   **D. Terms of Service & Seller Agreements:**
    *   Clearly outline rights and responsibilities of buyers, sellers, and the platform.
    *   Include policies on prohibited items, user conduct, dispute resolution, and payment terms.
*   **E. Intellectual Property:**
    *   Respect trademarks and copyrights of part manufacturers and brands.
    *   Mechanism for IP holders to report infringement.
*   **F. Secure Payment Processing:**
    *   If handling card data directly (not recommended), PCI DSS compliance is mandatory.
    *   Primarily rely on PCI DSS compliant payment gateways to offload this responsibility.

*   **Web Platform (Responsive Design):**
    *   **Primary Access Point:** A fully responsive web application accessible via desktop, laptop, and tablet browsers.
    *   **Key Use Cases:** Detailed product browsing and comparison, comprehensive seller account management (inventory, orders, financials), initial user discovery via search engines.
    *   **Benefits:** Wide accessibility, no installation required, ideal for complex tasks and larger screen viewing.

*   **Mobile Platform (Dedicated iOS & Android Apps):**
    *   **Native or Cross-Platform Apps:** Dedicated applications for iOS and Android devices.
    *   **Key Use Cases:** On-the-go part searching, quick order management, instant notifications, leveraging device-specific features (camera, location).
    *   **Benefits:** Enhanced user engagement, push notifications, access to device hardware, potentially better performance for specific tasks, offline capabilities.

A dual-platform approach (web and mobile apps) is recommended to cater to the diverse needs and preferences of both buyers and sellers. **Crucially, both the web and mobile frontends will be powered by a single, unified backend system and API (as detailed in section 4.B), ensuring data consistency and streamlined development.**

### B. Mobile-Specific Features & Considerations
While core functionality will be consistent, mobile applications can offer unique advantages:

*   **Push Notifications:** For real-time updates on orders, messages, price alerts, and promotions.
*   **Camera Integration:**
    *   Sellers: Easy photo uploads for listings.
    *   Buyers (Future): VIN scanning, visual part search.
*   **Location Services (with permission):** Finding nearby sellers for local pickup, location-based shipping estimates.
*   **Optimized UI/UX:** Streamlined navigation (e.g., bottom tabs), mobile-friendly forms, optimized image loading.
*   **Offline Capabilities (Limited):** Access to "My Garage," previously viewed items, drafting messages/listings.
*   **Biometric Authentication:** Fingerprint/Face ID for login and payments.
*   **Deep Linking:** Seamless transition from external links into specific app content.
