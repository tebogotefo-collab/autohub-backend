# Implementation Plan: Car Parts Marketplace

This plan outlines a phased approach to developing the Car Parts Marketplace, leveraging React (Web), React Native (Mobile), Spring Boot (Backend), and PostgreSQL (Database).

**Guiding Principles:**

*   **Iterative Development:** Build and release features in phases (MVP first).
*   **API-First Approach:** The Spring Boot backend will expose a comprehensive API that both web and mobile clients will consume.
*   **Shared Backend Logic:** All business logic, data processing, and database interactions will reside in the Spring Boot backend.
*   **Component-Based UI:** For React and React Native, focus on reusable components.

**Phase 1: Foundation - Core Backend & Database Setup**

*   **Objective:** Establish the backend infrastructure, database, and core user authentication. This is the absolute starting point.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Backend (Spring Boot & PostgreSQL):**
        1.  **Project Initialization:**
            *   Set up a new Spring Boot project (using Spring Initializr) with dependencies for Web, JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Spring Security, JWT.
            *   Configure `application.properties` or `application.yml` for database connection to PostgreSQL.
        2.  **Database Setup:**
            *   Create the PostgreSQL database instance (local or cloud).
            *   Set up a schema migration tool (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase) to manage database changes.
        3.  **Core Entity Modeling (JPA/Hibernate):**
            *   Define JPA entities for `User` (with roles: BUYER, SELLER, ADMIN), `Category`, `Brand`.
            *   Initial database schema migration for these entities.
        4.  **User Authentication & Authorization:**
            *   Implement Spring Security for user registration (email/password, hashed passwords).
            *   Implement JWT generation upon login and validation for protected endpoints.
            *   Basic role-based authorization (e.g., distinguishing between general user actions and potential admin actions later).
        5.  **Basic User Profile API:**
            *   Endpoints for users to view/update their own basic profile information.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Initial API documentation setup (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI for Spring Boot).

**Supporting Technical Specifications**

While the `CarPartsMarketplace_Design_Doc.md` and this `Implementation_Plan.md` provide a high-level roadmap, the following more granular technical specifications are typically developed or refined iteratively as the project progresses through the phases. They ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency:

1.  **Detailed API Specification (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger):**
    *   **Content:** Exact request/response schemas for every endpoint, data types, field descriptions, constraints, example requests/responses, specific error codes.
    *   **Development:** Evolves starting from **Phase 1** (Core Backend) and is continuously updated as new API endpoints are developed in subsequent backend tasks. Becomes the contract for frontend development.

2.  **Database Schema Diagram (Visual):**
    *   **Content:** Visual representation of tables, columns, data types, relationships (PKs, FKs), and indexes.
    *   **Development:** Created/refined during **Phase 1** (Database Setup) and updated as new entities are introduced (e.g., in Phase 2, 4, 5).

3.  **UI/UX Wireframes & High-Fidelity Mockups:**
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Wireframes:** Low-fidelity layouts for structure and content hierarchy.
        *   **Mockups:** High-fidelity designs showing visual appearance and branding.
    *   **Development:**
        *   Initial set for core buyer/seller web flows before **Phase 2** (Web Frontend) begins.
        *   Mobile-specific wireframes/mockups before **Phase 3** (Mobile App Core) begins.
        *   Updated/expanded for new features in subsequent phases (e.g., Checkout in Phase 4, "My Garage" in Phase 5).

4.  **Component Design Specifications (Frontend - Optional):**
    *   **Content:** Detailed specifications for complex/reusable UI components (props, state, events).
    *   **Development:** As needed during frontend development in **Phase 2 onwards**, especially if building a shared component library.

5.  **Deployment & Infrastructure Plan:**
    *   **Content:** Specific cloud service configurations, CI/CD pipeline details, environment management, backup/recovery.
    *   **Development:** Initial high-level thoughts during **Phase 1-2**; detailed planning becomes critical approaching MVP deployment (around **Phase 4-5**) and is refined for production.

6.  **Testing Strategy & Plan:**
    *   **Content:** Scope of unit, integration, end-to-end tests; performance and security testing approaches; tools.
    *   **Development:** High-level strategy defined early (**Phase 1-2**); detailed test plans and test cases developed iteratively for features within each phase.
